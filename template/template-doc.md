# Title

This is a doc format to explain something that is too abstract or either too long to be in a code snippet. So just write it down, and pretty please, inner linking.

For inner linking just create a github markdown link and in-between the parens put the heading text as hyphen case. 
    
    ex: if the heading reads "A heading" then the anchor link should be #a-heading  

## Index
